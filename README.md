# Hangman Game UI
This is the User Interface for the Hangman game. Built on ReactJS

## Setup
First, you will need to make sure you have the latest version of `node` installed as well as `npm`.

Next, clone this repository and then follow the instructions below:

* Install the npm packages:
```
$ npm install
```

* Start the development server
```
$ npm start
```

* While doing this, make sure the [API service](https://github.com/rawteech/hangman) is also running on a separate terminal window, (or whichever way you prefer)

* Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

* Login with the user credentials you have created from the API, or alternatively you can create more users on the django admin backend and login with those too

* Finally, you are logged in and can play the game!
